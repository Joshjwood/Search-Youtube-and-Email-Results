# Forked from the below
# [youtube-search-python](https://github.com/alexmercerind/youtube-search-python)

# This uses the above to perform Youtube searches based on query strings, ordered by most recent, filtering out those with less than 1000 views. It then takes those items and sends one email per query term with a list of the items it found, with some basic HTML to stop it looking too awful. Clickable thumbnails and some borders to make it look somewhat orderly.

# Running daily with cron
